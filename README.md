# -Simulation-of-CSTR-and-PFR-Reactors-using-DWSIM
This is a basic chemical engineering project using DWSIM to simulate a simple first-order isomerization reaction.

Project Description :

- Simulated the conversion of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene using both:
  - CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor)
  - PFR (Plug Flow Reactor)
- Compared the reactor volumes required to achieve 50%, 75%, and 90% conversion.
- Created visual plots using Excel to show how reactor volume changes with conversion.

Tools Used

- ðŸ§ª DWSIM (Peng-Robinson EOS)
- ðŸ“Š Microsoft Excel (for graph plotting)

ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

| Conversion (%) | CSTR Volume (mÂ³) | PFR Volume (mÂ³) |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 50             | 0.66708          | 0.4593           |
| 75             | 2.01584          | 0.922745         |
| 90             | 6.07047          | 1.54             |

- At high conversion, PFR requires significantly less volume than CSTR.
- Reinforces the concept that PFRs are more efficient for first-order reactions.

ðŸ“š Learning Outcome

- Learned basics of DWSIM for chemical reaction simulation.
- Understood how reactor type and conversion level affect design volume.
- Developed Excel skills for analyzing and plotting data.
